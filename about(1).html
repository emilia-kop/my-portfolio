     <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Shifa Ahad, a first-year Computer Science Engineering student at FISAT College of Engineering. I am an enthusiastic learner with a growing passion for web development and software programming. Currently, I'm building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I explore the world of front-end development.

Alongside web technologies, I’m also developing my skills in programming languages like Python, C, and C++, which help me understand problem-solving and logical thinking at a deeper level. I'm excited about the opportunities to apply what I learn through hands-on projects and continuous exploration of new tools and technologies.

As I grow in my field, I'm eager to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with like-minded learners, and eventually build innovative tech solutions that make a difference.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Web development and responsive design</li>
      <li>UI/UX principles and aesthetics</li>
      <li>Programming and building problem-solving applications</li>
     <li>Exploring new tools and frameworks</li>
      <li>Learning through real-world projects and collaboration</li>
      <li>Developing user-friendly and accessible tech solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm excited to continue growing and learning, and I look forward to contributing to innovative and impactful tech projects in the future.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to grow as a versatile developer by building strong skills across various domains, including front-end development, programming languages like Python and C++, and software problem-solving. I’m passionate about creating meaningful solutions—whether it’s a website, an application, or a simple tool—that are efficient, user-friendly, and impactful.
